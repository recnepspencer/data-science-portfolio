_THIS `.qmd` FILE SHOULD BE USED TO WRITE YOUR REPORT.  YOU WILL NEED TO COMPILE THE REPORT INTO A `.html` DOCUMENT AND SUBMIT IT ON CANVAS._

```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
```


## Elevator pitch

Here we learn that larger vehicles tend to have lower gas milage. It is an important purchasing consideration for both enviornmental and economic purposes. It confirms the hypothesis that large engines tend to use more fuel. It begs the question on whether companies should aim for smaller engines. 

```{python}
#| label: project data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Include and execute your code here
mpg = pd.read_csv('mpg.csv')
```

## Question|Task 1


```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
print(mpg
  .head(5)
  .filter(["manufacturer", "model","year", "hwy"])
  .to_markdown(index=False))


```

_Here we break down the mpg for each car based on its year._

```{python}
#| label: Q1 chart
#| code-summary: plot of data
#| fig-cap: "MPG Chart"
#| fig-align: center

px.scatter(mpg, x="displ", y="hwy", color="manufacturer")
```
